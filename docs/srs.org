* Introduction
** Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and
non-functional requirements of warehouse management system software.
A Warehouse Management System (WMS) is a complex software package that
helps manage inventory, storage locations, and the workforce, to
ensure that customer orders are picked quickly, packed, and shipped.
A typical WMS knows about every item in the warehouse, its physical
dimensions, how it is packed by the vendor, all the storage locations
in the warehouse, and their addresses and physical dimensions The WMS
receives customer orders and transforms them to pick lists organized
for easy retrieval WMS tracks the assembly of each customer order.

** Scope
The scope of this project include: 
- record the arrival and departure of inventory.
- recording the precise location of stock within the warehouse.
- optimising the use of available space.
- coordinating tasks for maximum efficiency.
- dealing with returns: 
    - monitor and track the returned inventory.
- storing barcode, and labels for easier storage and retrieval. 
- real-time tracking for shipping

** Definitions
*** Logistics
Logistics coordinates the movement and storage of resources such as
goods, equipment and inventory. For manufacturers, logistics starts
wiReceiving and Putaway:th the incoming supply of raw materials and carries through to the
delivery of finished products to customers.

* Overall description
** System Environment

*** The product flow
The supply chain is the sequence of processes through which product
moves from its origin toward the customer.

@@latex:\vspace*{\baselineskip}@@
The supply chaing consist of:
- Inbound logistics is the way materials and other goods are brought
  into a company. This process includes the steps to order, receive,
  store, transport and manage incoming supplies.
- Outbound logistics focuses on the demand side of the supply-demand
  equation. The process involves storing and moving goods to the
  customer or end user. The steps include order fulfillment, packing,
  shipping, delivery and customer service related to delivery.

** Product Functions
*** Functional Requirements
**** The warhouse user registration
- The administrator is elligable of registering users.
- Each employee should be registered in the warehouse in order use
  warehouse utilities.

**** Inventory management
- *Stock Tracking*\\
  The system should maintain accurate records of the current stock
  quantities for each product, including the ability to track inventory
  at different levels (e.g., overall warehouse, zones, or specific
  locations).

- *Product Information*\\
  The system should store and manage detailed product information, such
  as product codes, master data, descriptions, dimensions, weights, and
  any other relevant attributes.

- *Locations and Zones*\\
  The system should allow for the definition and management of different
  storage locations and zones within the warehouse, enabling efficient
  organization and retrieval of inventory.

- *Reorder Management*\\
  The system should have mechanisms for setting reorder points and
  generating purchase orders or replenishment requests when inventory
  levels fall below specified thresholds.

- *Alerts and Notifications*\\
  The system should provide configurable alerts and notifications for
  low stock levels, expired products, or other inventory-related events
  that require attention.

- *Reporting and Analytics*\\
  The system should offer robust reporting and analytics capabilities
  for inventory-related data, including stock reports, inventory
  turnover rates, and more.

**** Inbound processes
- *Receiving*
  - *The process of receiving goods pass through the following sequence of
     operations:*
    - Receiving goods begins with a notification of the arrival of goods
    - Once the product is arrived it is unloaded and possibly staged for
      put away.
    - The product will be scanned to register its arrival so that
      owenership is assumed, payments dispatched, and so that it is known
      to be available to fulfill customer demand.
    - The product will be inspected and any exceptions noted, such as
      damage, incorrect counts, wrong descriptions.

  - *Barcode and RFID Scanning*\\
      The system should support barcode and RFID scanning for rapid and
      accurate identification of incoming products.

- *Put-away*
  - Before the product can be put away, The following operations should be
    performed:
      - An appropriate storage location must be dertermined.
      - The group to which the product belongs to should also be detemined.

  - The system shall support putaway verification through
    barcode scanning, ensuring that items are placed in the correct locations.

@@latex:\clearpage@@
**** Outbound Processes
- *Order Picking*\\
    Order picking is the process of collecting items from a warehouse to complete customer orders,
    It consists of:
      - Checking:
        - verifying that the inventory is available to ship.
        - Checks the order against available inventory and identifies any shortages.
      - The warehouse must produce pick lists to guide the order-picking.
      - The warehouse must produce any necessary shipping documentation and schedule
        the order-picking and shipping.

- *Returns Management*\\
  The system should support the processing of customer returns,
  including receiving, inspection, and restocking or disposal of
  returned items.
    

- *Purchase Order Notification*
  - The warehouse / user should receive a notifications upon sending a purchase
    order .
  - customers shall receive notifications about order confirmation,
    order fulfillment, and shipping details.

- *Reporting and Analytics*\\
  The system should provide comprehensive reporting and analytics
  capabilities related to order fulfillment, such as order status.
